1) Query to find closest major city in Canada:
  SELECT *
  FROM city_list
  WHERE country IN ('Canada')
  ORDER BY city

2) Picked Toronto as the major city. Query to extract Toronto temperature data:
  SELECT *
  FROM city_data
  WHERE city='Toronto'

3) Query to extract global yearly temperatures
  SELECT *
  FROM global_data

  Combine query 2 and 3:
  SELECT city_data.year,
        city_data.avg_temp as city_temp,
        global_data.avg_temp as global_temp
  FROM city_data, global_data
  WHERE city_data.year=global_data.year
      AND city_data.city = 'Toronto'
      AND NOT city_data.avg_temp IS NULL

4) City with lowest average temp: Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia (since 1820)
  SELECT city, avg(avg_temp) AS combined_avg_temp
  FROM city_data
  GROUP BY city
  ORDER BY combined_avg_temp

5) City with highest average temp: Khartoum, Sudan (since 1859), Bangkok (1816)
  SELECT city, avg(avg_temp) AS combined_avg_temp
  FROM city_data
  GROUP BY city
  ORDER BY combined_avg_temp DESC

6) City with median average temp: Colombo, Brazil (since 1832), Athens (close to median, since 1753)
  SELECT city, country, avg(avg_temp) AS combined_avg_temp
  FROM city_data
  GROUP BY country, city
  ORDER BY combined_avg_temp
  LIMIT 173 (since 345 entries total)


Missing Values Handling:
- Missing 2014-2015 data in all cities, estimated values using moving average with n = 5. Smaller value of n used due to increasing frequency of higher temperatures in the recent past

Moving Average Calculation Reasoning:
      - n = 10 till year 1950, n = 7 from 1950 onwards due to higher frequency of increasing co2 levels around the world
      - n = 5 since 1995, higher annual growth of co2 https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/gr.html
      - n = 3 since 2005, even higher annual growth of co2
      - Exception for colder regions: Kept n=7 till 2005, n=5 2005 onwards due to higher variance in colder areas

CO2 Levels and Global Warming:
- Co2 levels on earth: https://climate.nasa.gov/climate_resources/24/
- Ignore pre 1850 temperature data due to Little Ice Age that lasted until mid 1850: https://www.britannica.com/science/Little-Ice-Age
- Industrial Revolution: https://www.ducksters.com/history/us_1800s/timeline_industrial_revolution.php
